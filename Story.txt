Chapter 1
You wake up on a beach.
All you remember is the sinking of the ship and your name. 
The shipwreck can be seen in the distance. 
The ship looks rather scary.
There seem to be some mysterious beings surrounding it.
They do not feel like beings you can easily approach.
You stand up and look around. 
A chest! You run towards it and open it to find your items. 
You gather them all up and start walking
You reach a town.
